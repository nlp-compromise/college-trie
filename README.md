`efrt` is a prefix/suffix [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) optimised for compression of english words.

it is based on [mckoss/lookups](https://github.com/mckoss/lookups) by [Mike Koss](https://github.com/mckoss)
 and [bits.js](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=120) by [Steve Hanov](https://twitter.com/smhanov)

 * squeeze a list of words into a very compact form
 * reduce filesize/bandwidth a bunch
 * ensure unpacking overhead is negligible
 * word-lookups are critical-path

By doing the fancy stuff ahead-of-time, **efrt** lets you ship much bigger word-lists to the client-side, without much hassle.

```js
var efrt = require('efrt')
var words = [
  'coolage',
  'cool',
  'cool cat',
  'cool.com',
  'coolamungo'
];

//pack these words as tightly as possible
var compressed = efrt.pack(words);
//cool0;! cat,.com,a0;ge,mungo

//create a lookup-trie
var trie = efrt.unpack(compressed);

//hit it!
console.log(trie.has('cool'));//true
console.log(trie.has('miles davis'));//false
```

the words you input should be pretty normalized. Spaces and unicode are good, but numbers, case-sensitivity, and [some punctuation](https://github.com/nlp-compromise/efrt/blob/master/src/config.js) are not (yet) supported.


##Performance
there are two modes that `efrt` can run in, depending on what you want to optimise for.
By itself, it will be ready-instantly, but must lookup words by their prefixes in the trie. This is not super-fast. If you want lookups to go faster, you can call `trie.cache()` first, to pre-compute the queries. Things will run much faster after this:
```js
var compressed = efrt.pack(skateboarders);//1k words (on a macbook)
var trie = efrt.unpack(compressed)
trie.has('tony hawk')
// trie-lookup: 1.1ms

trie.cache()
// caching-step: 5.1ms

trie.has('tony hawk')
// cached-lookup: 0.02ms
```
the `trie.cache()` command will spin the trie into a good-old javascript object, for faster lookups. It takes some time building it though.

In this example, with 1k words, it makes sense to hit `.cache()` if you are going to do more-than 5 lookups on the trie, but your mileage may vary.
You can access the object from `trie.toObject()`, or `trie.toArray()` if you'd like use it directly.

## Size
`efrt` will pack filesize down as much as possible, depending upon the redundancy of the prefixes/suffixes in the words, and the size of the list.
* list of countries - `1.5k -> 0.8k` *(46% compressed)*
* all adverbs in wordnet - `58k -> 24k` *(58% compressed)*
* all adjectives in wordnet - `265k -> 99k` *(62% compressed)*
* all nouns in wordnet - `1,775k -> 692k` *(61% compressed)*

but there are some things to consider:
* bigger files compress further (see [ðŸŽˆ birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem))
* using efrt will reduce gains from gzip compression, which most webservers quietly use
* english is more suffix-redundant than prefix-redundant, so non-english words may benefit from other styles

##Use
**IE9+**
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/efrt@latest/builds/efrt.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var smaller=efrt.pack(['larry','curly','moe'])
  var trie=efrt.unpack(smaller)
  console.log(trie.has('moe'))
</script>
```

if you're doing the second step in the client, you can load just the unpack-half of the library(~3k):
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/efrt@latest/builds/efrt-unpack.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var trie=unpack(compressedStuff);
  trie.has('miles davis');
</script>
```
